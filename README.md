Sensorflow
==========
Today there are a lot of types of sensors and every type works in a different way.
Sensorflow is an interface for all these sensors, like a plug&play.

You want a temperature sensor? Just plug it and fun! Don't waste time searching how
every sensor works.

Also you get some other benefits when using Sensorflow:
 * Energy save: The device goes to sleep when needed
 * Bidirectional communication: You sensor can be passive (you read the sensor when you want) and active, the sensor notifies you when something happens.
 * Device detection: Know when a sensor is plugged or unplugged (like usb)
